1) What counts as "high-cost"?
Spending that exceeds the 75th percentile (Top 25% spender)

2) Is the goal reducing cost or identifying who needs intervention early?
- The goal is to reduce long-term costs through early diagnosis & intervention. While costs may be high, they will eventually plateau in the long run depending on the model efficiency.
- We will optimize for fewer false negatives
